# Landing Page Project HVAC


**Status:** _Work in Progress_

I haven’t finished this landing page yet! I'm currently resolving some layout issues and working on final touches to complete the design.

## Key Highlights

- **Responsive Layout with Floats and `calc()`:** This project was built using **only floats** and the `calc()` function to achieve a responsive layout—without any media queries. By creatively using floats, I replicated the responsive behavior typically achieved with Flexbox.
- **`calc()` for Dynamic Sizing:** The `calc()` function was used to manage dynamic sizing and spacing, allowing precise control over layout adjustments without needing media queries.

## Current Status

### Completed
- **Layout with Floats:** All main layout sections are structured using floats, including the header, hero section, and featured content blocks. This approach provided responsive behavior traditionally handled by Flexbox.
- **Basic Styling:** Text, images, and content blocks are styled with colors, fonts, and spacing. Additional adjustments to text sizing and spacing are still in progress.
- **Responsive Design without Media Queries:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices—accomplished without any media queries.

### To Do
- **Finalize Text Sizing and Spacing:** Further adjustments are needed to ensure consistency in text sizing, spacing, and alignment across the site.
- **Implement Animations:** Interactive animations are not yet implemented. Planned animations include:
  - Hover effects on buttons and images
  - Smooth transitions between sections
  - Scroll-based animations to enhance user engagement
