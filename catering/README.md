# Landing Page Project (Inspired by W3)

This project is a redesign and restructured version of a classic W3 landing page. The core design inspiration comes from W3's iconic landing layout, but with a complete overhaul of the code structure to improve flexibility, responsiveness, and maintainability. The page is still a work in progress.
