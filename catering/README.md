# Landing Page Project (Inspired by W3)
## I studied the other landing page of W3 about catering 
*visit [Catering](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_gourmet_catering.htm)
This project is a redesign and restructured version of a classic W3 landing page. The core design inspiration comes from W3's iconic landing layout, but with a complete overhaul of the code structure to improve flexibility, responsiveness, and maintainability. The page is still a work in progress.

# haven't used 'media query' yet, yet I'll do on next update of code!!!

## here some of what I added in css based on what I understood

 **flex: 1 1 45%;** 
 /*Allows flexibility in width A value of first flex-grow:"1" means will grow evenly with other items,sec"1" flex-shrink: 1 
  &flex-basis: 45%:This sets the initial size of the flex*/
  **max-width: 45%;**
  /*Maximum width to ensure balance*/

  **-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;**
  /*implementing a general CSS solution for text resizing*/
   /*Prevents text size adjustments in WebKit browsers*/
