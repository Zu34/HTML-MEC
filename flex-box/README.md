# Landing Page Project

**Status:** _Work in Progress_

I havenâ€™t finished this landing page yet! I'm currently resolving some layout issues and working on final touches to complete the design.

## Current Status

### Completed
- **Layout with Flexbox:** All main layout sections are structured using Flexbox, including the header, hero section, and featured content blocks.
- **Basic Styling:** Text, images, and content blocks are styled with colors, fonts, and spacing. However, some text sizing and spacing adjustments are still pending.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, providing a good user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### To Do
- **Finalize Text Sizing and Spacing:** Further adjustments are needed to ensure consistent text sizing, spacing, and alignment across the site.
- **Implement Animations:** Interactive animations have not yet been implemented. Planned animations include:
  - Hover effects on buttons and images
  - Smooth transitions between sections
  - Scroll-based animations to enhance user engagement
